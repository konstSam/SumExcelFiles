# Sum Multiple Excel Files containing a specific key value

This Python code recursively searches for Excel files in a specified directory. It searches for the key value cell, "Overview", in each file and calculates the total sum of the values. It also prints the percentage of return total for each file and the total sum for all portfolios.
